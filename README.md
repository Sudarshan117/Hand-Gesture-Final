# **Hand Gesture–Based Game Automation Web App**

This project demonstrates game automation using real-time hand gesture recognition. By combining computer vision, gesture tracking, and key mapping, it allows you to control a game (like GTA V, NFS, etc.) using your hands instead of a keyboard or controller.

**📌 Features**

Real-time hand tracking using a webcam.

Gesture-to-action mapping (e.g., ✊ fist = brake, ✋ open palm = accelerate).

Seamless integration with PC games via automated key presses.

Configurable controls – map gestures to any game action.

WebApp Demo showcasing live gesture input, FPS, and key events.

**🛠️ Tech Stack**

Python 3.8+

OpenCV – video capture & image processing

Mediapipe – real-time hand tracking

PyAutoGUI / PyDirectInput – simulate keyboard inputs

Flask / Streamlit (optional) – for web-based visualization
